HTTP proxy that can be used to get around browser restrictions that prevent
cross-domain Ajax requests. It supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and probably
any HTTP method.

This script requires the httplib2 module (Debian users can install the
"python-httplib2" package).

That script works as a Apache mod_python handler. Example of Apache config
(assuming this script is place in the directory /var/www/proxy/):

Alias /proxy/ /var/www/proxy/
<Directory "/var/www/proxy">
    AddHandler python-program .py
    PythonHandler http-proxy
</Directory>

The target URL is specified in the URL path. Example:

GET /proxy/http-proxy.py/http,host.domain,81/dir/file?key=value

In this example, the request will be forwared to this URL:
http://host.domain:81/dir/file?key=value
