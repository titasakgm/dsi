Due to security restrictions in JavaScript, it is not possible to do
cross-domain XMLHttpRequest's.

Some examples, like geostat and search, use XMLHttpRequest's. If those
XMLHttpRequest's target a different domain that the serving the page, some
proxy is required.

You case use proxy.cgi (provided in this directory). proxy.cgi must be copied
under your web server CGI directory (/usr/lib/cgi-bin for a standard Apache
configuration). proxy.cgi must also be edited and the variable allowedHosts
must be adapted.

In the JavaScript code, the OpenLayers.ProxyHost variable must be set
appropriately. Edit the examples.js file to set it for all the examples.
